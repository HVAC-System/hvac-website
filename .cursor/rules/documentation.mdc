# Documentation Rules

- Use JSDoc to document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
- Write clear, concise, and complete descriptions for all code documentation
- Add usage examples in documentation where appropriate
- Maintain a high-level project overview in `README.md` at the root; update it with every major change
- Use a `/docs` directory for extended documentation if needed; update docs in the same PR as code changes
- Use Storybook to document and showcase UI components; keep stories in sync with components
- Use proper markdown formatting: `#` for headings, ```` ``` ```` for code blocks, `-` for lists, and links for references
- Link to external resources or references where helpful
