# Accessibility (a11y) Rules

- Use semantic HTML for all content and structure.
- Apply accurate ARIA attributes and roles where needed (refer to WAI-ARIA spec).
- Ensure full keyboard navigation support (all interactive elements must be focusable and usable via keyboard).
- Manage focus order and visibility (use focus traps and visible focus indicators).
- Maintain accessible color contrast ratios (WCAG AA or better).
- Follow a logical heading hierarchy (no skipped heading levels).
- All interactive elements must be accessible by screen readers.
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with form fields and announced by screen readers.
- Use axe-core and Lighthouse in CI to check accessibility; fail builds on critical issues.
- Test focus management and tab order in all interactive flows.
