# Testing Rules & Best Practices

- Use **Jest** for unit and integration testing
- Use **React Testing Library** for React component tests
- Place test files in `__tests__` directories or alongside components as `.test.tsx`/`.test.ts`
- Name test files after the component or function they test
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., API calls, third-party libraries) using Jest mocks or MSW
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests (e.g., 'Arrange: setup, Act: execute, Assert: check result')
- Use snapshot testing only for stable, low-change UI components
- Require at least 80% code coverage for all new code (enforced in CI)
- Run all tests in CI before merging
- Use `jest.setup.js` for global mocks and setup
